# React Tip Calculator

A modern **Tip Calculator App** built with **React + TypeScript**, powered by **Zustand** for state management and **GSAP** for premium UI micro-interactions.

This project is part of my portfolio, designed to demonstrate **clean React architecture, state handling, component design, and polished UI/UX animations**.
